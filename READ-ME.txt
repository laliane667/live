- This webpage is inspired from Ableton Live webpage. Here: < https://www.ableton.com/en/live/ >
- You can find my version of the website online on my github. Here: < https://laliane667.github.io/live/ >

- All html, css and js is written by me (Elian Lamouroux) but images, text content and videos
are took from internet.
- Audios were created by me using ableton live app.

-Issue with my website:
    1/ I did not develop this website for mobile screen resolution so please open it on a computer :)
    2/ I wanted to use iframe for youtube video preview and it worked BUT it generated lot of errors in console so I removed it
